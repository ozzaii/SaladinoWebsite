# 🚀 SALADINO TRAVELS WEBSITE CREATION BRIEF

## MISSION CRITICAL CONTEXT

Listen up, coding superhero! You're about to build an ENTIRE travel website for Saladino Travel in a single agentic session - one that will transform their business from "that Turkish tour company" into a digital powerhouse. Game on! 💪

### The Client Reality

Saladino Travel specializes in premium guided tours of Turkey and Dubai. They're established operators with killer tour packages, but their digital presence is... let's just say it's stuck in 2010. Their customers are primarily Spanish-speaking travelers from Latin America looking for exceptional cultural experiences.

Three tour packages form their bread and butter:
- **Super Turkey Tour** (9 days) - The full experience
- **Istanbul-Cappadocia** (6 days) - The essential highlights
- **Turkey-Dubai Combined** (11 days) - The premium extended adventure

Their competitive edge? Deep local knowledge, premium accommodations, and extraordinary attention to detail in their tour operations.

## THE WEBSITE VISION

We're building a conversion-focused, visually stunning travel site that leverages Gemini Flash 2.0 AI to create personalized experiences. This isn't just a pretty brochure - it's a 24/7 digital sales agent that builds trust, answers questions, and drives bookings.

### Core User Journeys

1. **Inspiration Phase** → Stunning visuals and stories that create emotional connection
2. **Research Phase** → Detailed, trust-building tour information and AI assistance
3. **Decision Phase** → Clear pricing, availability, and seamless booking process
4. **Pre-Travel Phase** → Account area with itineraries and preparation information

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (THE SMART STUFF)

### Frontend Architecture

Build this as a modern React SPA with these technical decisions:

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (strictly typed = fewer bugs)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Context API with custom hooks pattern
- **Routing**: React Router with lazy-loaded components for performance
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for subtle, conversion-enhancing animations
- **Internationalization**: i18next for Spanish/English content management
- **Performance**: Next.js for SSR/SSG optimization

### Backend Strategy  

Keep it lean! Use a headless CMS approach:

- **Content Management**: Contentful or Sanity for marketing/tour content
- **Bookings**: Integrate with industry-standard booking APIs (or build minimal booking service)
- **Deployment**: Vercel or Netlify for edge-optimized global performance
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or NextAuth for secure customer accounts
- **API Strategy**: RESTful pattern with clean separation of concerns
